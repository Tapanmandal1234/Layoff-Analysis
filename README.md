# 🧠 Layoff Analysis Project

This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of global layoff trends from 2020 to 2025 using Python and real-world datasets.
Through visual analytics and correlation modeling, it reveals:
- When and where the highest layoff spikes occurred
- Which industries and countries were most affected
- How startup stage and funding levels relate to layoffs
- Whether raising millions in capital protects companies from downsizing

## 🎯 Key Insights

- 🔺 **January 2023 marked the peak of global layoffs**, with over 70,000 recorded in a single month.
- 🏢 **Consumer, Retail, and Transportation sectors** faced the highest total layoffs.
- 🌍 The **United States** accounted for the majority of reported layoffs worldwide.
- 💰 Surprisingly, there's **no strong correlation between funding raised and percentage laid off** — some well-funded firms laid off 100% of their workforce.
- 🧪 **Seed and Series A companies had the highest average layoff rates**, showing early-stage risk under market pressure.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

- **Python stack**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Google Colab**: Interactive environment for code + charts
- **EDA & Visualization**: Trendlines, bar charts, scatter plots
- **Business analytics**: Real-world relevance, executive-ready visuals
